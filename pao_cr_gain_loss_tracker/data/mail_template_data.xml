                        As we discussed, I wanted to provide you with access to the documentation 
                        related to the PrimusGFS audit. You can find the documents by following the 
                        link below. Please navigate past the Addendums section and focus on the General 
                        Regulations, Questions &amp; Expectations, and Interpretation Guidelines. For a 
                        Cooler/Cooler Cold Storage operation, please note that you will need to undergo 
                        audits for Module 1: Food Safety Management System, Module 5: Facility, and 
                        Module 6: HACCP. Module 7: Preventive Control is optional.
