                                        not a governing agency, and does not set the industry standards for safety or protocol. Customer also acknowledges 
                                        that Primus Auditing Ops. provides results of audits and makes no representation or warranty regarding the quality 
                                        of the Customer's products, facility, fields, methods, or other audited subjects, or whether it complies with

                                        <b>7. RIGHT TO REFERRAL.</b> Customer acknowledges that Primus Auditing Ops is, or may, contract out the 
                                        auditing services performed for Customer. Because an independent auditor is engaged in his/her own independent 
                                        contracting business and is not an employee of Primus Auditing Ops, Primus Auditing Ops will not obtain insurance 
                                        (professional liability, workers' compensation, general liability, auto, etc.) for the auditor or his/her employees. 
                                        Independent auditors agree by a separate referral agreement to obtain his/her own insurance coverage and furnish a 
                                        copy of the certificate of insurance to Primus Auditing Ops. Furthermore, in those instances in which an independent 
                                        auditor is retained, Primus Auditing Ops will be acting in the sole capacity of independent contractor and any 
                                        information or data received will be merely transmitted between parties, making no independent judgment, representations 
                                        or warranties as to the facts, observations or inferences made relative to the same.

                                        and shall end at the time of the Certification's expiration. Provided that the representations and warranties, and ongoing 
                                        obligations shall continue beyond the termination of this Agreement.
