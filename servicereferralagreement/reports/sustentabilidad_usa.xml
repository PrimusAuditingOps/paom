                Standard TM ” and accompanying logo (collectively “Sustainability Standard Trademark”) in a manner consistent with 
                the terms in the attached Addendum “A” and the Sustainable Food Group Sustainability Standard TM General Regulations. 
                Customer's failure to comply with the requirements found in Addendum “A” and the General Regulations can result in suspension

                and Sustainable Food Group, that it learns during the auditing process, confidential and will not discuss or divulge such 
                information to any party other than Primus Auditing Ops and/or Sustainable Food Group. Customer further agrees not to copy, 
                reproduce, disclose or publish any confidential information it comes across during the duration of Certification.
                <br/>
                <br/>

            Customer hereby releases Primus Auditing Ops, Azzule Systems, their respective affiliates including but not limited to employees, 
            officers, directors, shareholders, from any loss or liability suffered by Customer, as defined below, resulting from services 
            performed under this Agreement. Such release shall include any actual, incidental, consequential or other damages beyond amounts 
            paid to Primus Auditing Ops for auditing performed and/or facilitated by Primus Auditing Ops. Customer further acknowledges and 
            agrees that Primus Auditing Ops' liability is limited only to audit work performed by it, and the parties expressly acknowledge 
            that Primus Auditing Ops is not liable for Customer's commodity, its safety, or quality. Customer further releases and holds 
            Sustainable Food Group harmless from any liability whatsoever for the services provided under this Agreement,
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <b>7. GOVERNING LAW / VENUE.</b>
            This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California. In the event that it is 
            necessary to institute any action to enforce any right granted herein or to redress any alleged breach hereof, then the exclusive 
            venue for such action shall reside with the applicable Superior or Municipal Court located in Santa Maria, California.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <b>8. GOVERNING AGENCY COMPLIANCE.</b> Customer expressly acknowledges that Primus Auditing Ops and its auditors are not a 
                governing agency, and does not set the industry standards for safety or protocol. Customer also acknowledges that Primus 
                Auditing Ops provides results of audits and makes no representation or warranty regarding the quality of the Customer's 
                products, facility, fields, methods, or other audited subjects, or whether it complies with regulation standards.

            </p>
            <p>

                <b>9. RIGHT TO REFERRAL.</b>
            Customer acknowledges that Primus Auditing Ops is, or may, contract out the auditing services performed for Customer. Because an 
            independent auditor is engaged in his/her own independent contracting business and is not an employee of Primus Auditing Ops, 
            Primus Auditing Ops will not obtain insurance (professional liability, workers' compensation, general liability, auto, etc.) for 
            the auditor or his/her employees. Independent auditors agree by a separate referral agreement to obtain his/her own insurance 
            coverage and furnish a copy of the certificate of insurance to Primus Auditing Ops. Furthermore, in those instances in which an 
            independent auditor is retained, Primus Auditing Ops will be acting in the sole capacity of an independent contractor and 
            any information or data received will be merely transmitted between parties, making no independent judgment, representations or 
            warranties as to the facts, observations or inferences made relative to the same. Logo use must be consistent with the SFG 
            General Regulations, and Customer must both get permission to use the marks, and the marks themselves, from SFG.
                <br/>
                <br/>

                <b>10. TERM AND TERMINATION.</b>
            This Agreement shall be good valid throughout the duration of Customer's Certification, and shall end at the time of the 
            Certification's expiration. Provided that the representations and warranties, and ongoing obligations shall continue beyond 
            the termination of this Agreement.

                        <b>Termination for Cause.</b> If either party fails to fulfill any term or condition of this Agreement, such 
                        failure shall constitute a breach of this Agreement by that party. The breaching Party shall have 10 
                        calendar days from the time of receipt of written notice of such breach, to cure such breach. If after 10 days, 
                        the breaching party has not cured the breach, the non-breaching party may termination this agreement with no 
                        further obligations.</li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Voluntary Termination.</b> Either party may voluntarily terminate this agreement upon fifteen days' written 
                        notice to the other party. If this Agreement is terminated by Customer, any certification granted by Primus 
                        Auditing Ops to Customer shall terminate immediately.</li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Termination by Customer After Desktop Review Portion of Audit.</b> If Customer voluntarily terminated this 
                        Agreement in accordance with Section 10.b. above, but after Primus Auditing Ops has begun the desktop review 
                        portion of the audit, Customer acknowledges and agrees that it shall be responsible for, and shall pay to Primus 
                        Auditing Ops, an amount equal to ONE-THIRD (1/3) of the Audit Fee indicated in the “Audit Fee/Total Services” 
                        box on page 1 of this Agreement. Failure on Customer's behalf to do so is a material breach of this Agreement by 
                        Customer.</li>

                <b>11 PAYMENT AND CANCELLATIONS.</b>
            The Customer agrees to pay Primus Auditing Ops within 30 days of billing. All services rendered by Primus Auditing Ops are 
            provided on a non-refundable basis. Customer acknowledges that Primus Auditing Ops will make its best effort to ensure that 
            all invoices are correctly issued. However, should Customer note any possible errors, Customer agrees to notify our Billing 
            Department within 10 days of the issuance of the errant invoice.

            conditions, all of which Contracting Party acknowledges and agrees:
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <ul type="1">
                <li>
                Customer can only use the trademark and/or logo when there is a valid Sustainability Standard TM certificate linked to that 
                organization and clear reference to the certified operations. The logo can only be used for business to business communications 
                and marketing purposes (press releases, social media posts, websites, etc.), as long as the operation and crop certified are 
                specified.

                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                The use of the Sustainability Standard Trademark shall not appear on the product, or consumer packaging, nor shall it be used at 
                the point of sale in direct connection to single products.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                Customer, as a certified operation, will only use the Sustainability Standard Trademark in a manner consistent with the 
                registered scope of their certification. Operations and/or products not included in the certified operations registered 
                scope are not certified and Customer is prohibited from using the Logo in any way that would indicate or imply otherwise:
                    <ul type="a">
                        <br/>
                        <li>This requires that Customer be up to date in payment of all fees due by Customer to Primus Auditing Ops and 
                        Sustainable Food Group</li>
                        <br/>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                The Sustainability Standard Trademark must be obtained from Primus Auditing Operations, in order to ensure conformance with 
                exact corporate color and format, and may only be used in a manner consistent with Sustainability Standard TM requirements.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>Customer shall at all times cooperate with Sustainable Food Group and its agents (including Primus Auditing Ops) to 
                allow reasonable access to verify compliance with these requirements.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>Sustainable Food Group or Primus Auditing Ops may suspend Customer's sublicense for use of the Sustainability Standard 
                Trademark if, at Sustainable Food Group or Primus Auditing Ops sole discretion, it determines that:
                    <ul type="a">
                        <br/>
                        <li>Customer fails to comply with these rules;,</li>
                        <li>Customer fails to meet re-certification requirements;</li>
                        <li>Customer uses the logo in a manner that is detrimental to Sustainable Food Group or the Sustainability Standard TM</li>
                        <li>Customer fails to correct issues or conditions that led to suspension of Customers use of the Sustainability 
                        Standard Trademark within 15 days of notification of the violation and suspension;</li>
                        <li>Customer's certified operation ceases operations or files for bankruptcy protection.</li>
                        <li>Upon written notice to Customer of such suspension or revocation, Customer agrees to immediately discontinue using 
                        Sustainability Standard Trademark and cease use of promotional materials, websites or communications on which the 
                        Sustainability Standard Trademark is published.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>In addition to suspension or revocation of the use of the Sustainability Standard Trademark as outlined in 
                Section 6.d. above, a violation of the use of the Sustainability Standard Trademark, as outlined herein and in the 
                Sustainability Food Group Sustainability Standard General Regulations, shall constitute a breach of the Agreement by 
                Customer. In the event that Customer, its employees, or officers, improperly use the Sustainability Standard Trademark 
                without the consent of Primus Auditing Ops or Sustainable Food Group, Customer shall have fifteen (15) calendar days, 
                following written notice from Primus Auditing Ops or the Scheme Owner of the improper use, to cure the improper use. 
                If Customer fails to cure the improper use, the Agreement is voidable by Primus Auditing Ops, and Customer's certification, 
                and the documents associated therewith, will be immediately revoked.
                </li>
            </ul>

            Nothing herein shall be construed to relieve the parties from their respective obligations under the Agreement.
