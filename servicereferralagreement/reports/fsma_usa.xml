                                        a governing agency, and does not set the industry standards for safety or protocol. Customer also acknowledges that Primus 
                                        Auditing Ops. provides results of audits and makes no representation or warranty regarding the quality of the Customer's 
                                        products, facility, fields, methods, or other audited subjects. The client acknowledges and agrees that Primus Auditing Ops 
                                        is not a representative of the United Stated Food and Drug Administration (FDA), nor is it a representative of any other 
                                        federal, state, or local governmental agency. As such, Primus Auditing Ops does not have the authority to make representation 
                                        or warranties on behalf of any governmental agency. The client is solely responsible for compliance with all applicable

                                        <b>6. RIGHT TO REFERRAL.</b> Customer acknowledges that Primus Auditing Ops is, or may, contract out the auditing services 
                                        performed for Customer. Because an independent auditor is engaged in his/her own independent contracting business and is 
                                        not an employee of Primus Auditing Ops, Primus Auditing Ops will not obtain insurance (professional liability, workers' 
                                        compensation, general liability, auto, etc.) for the auditor or his/her employees. Independent auditors agree by a separate 
                                        referral agreement to obtain his/her own insurance coverage and furnish a copy of the certificate of insurance to Primus 
                                        Auditing Ops. Furthermore, in those instances in which an independent auditor is retained, Primus Auditing Ops will be 
                                        acting in the sole capacity of independent contractor and any information or data received will be merely transmitted 
                                        between parties, making no independent judgment, representations or warranties as to the facts, observations or inferences 
                                        made relative to the same.

                                        terminated by Customer or Primus Auditing Ops, as provided for below. Representations, warranties, and any corresponding 
                                        obligations thereto, made in the course of this Agreement shall continue beyond termination.

                                                of this Agreement by that party. In such a circumstance, the non-breaching party shall provide, by regular mail, 
                                                written notice to the breaching party and include a sufficient description of the relevant conduct in violation 
                                                of this Agreement. The breaching party shall have 15 days from the date the notice is mailed to cure the breach 
                                                and come into compliance with the terms of this Agreement. If, after 15 days, the breaching party has not cured
