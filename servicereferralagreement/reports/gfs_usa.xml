                <br />
                <b>3. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</b> Customer hereby releases Primus Auditing Ops and Primus Group Inc.

                resulting from services performed under this Agreement. Such release shall include any actual, incidental, 
                consequential or other damages beyond amounts paid to Primus Auditing Ops for auditing performed and/or facilitated 
                by Primus Auditing Ops. Customer further acknowledges and agrees that Primus Auditing Ops' liability is limited 
                only to audit work performed by it, and the parties expressly acknowledge that Primus Auditing Ops is not liable 
                for Customer's commodity, its safety, or quality.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>4. GOVERNING LAW / VENUE.</b> This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws

                <br />
                <b>5. GLOBAL FOOD SAFETY INITIATIVE and PRIMUSGFS.</b>
                Customer expressly acknowledges that Primus Auditing Ops and its auditors are not a governing agency, and does 
                not set the industry standards for safety or protocol. Customer also acknowledges that PrimusGFS is an audit 
                program benchmarked and governed by the Global Food Safety Initiative's (GFSI) standards and promulgated requirements. 
                All results posted by Primus Auditing Ops will be based on GFSI criteria. Customer expressly acknowledges that 
                Primus Auditing Ops has not created these standards and criteria, but is only acting in accordance with GFSI.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>CONSENT TO RELEASE INFORMATION - GFSI AND SCHEME OWNER.</b>
                        As part of its requirements for benchmarking Audit schemes to the GFSI standard, GFSI requires that all 
                        contracting parties for GFSI benchmarked audits authorize the Certification Body to make all audit records 
                        from Customer's audit available to the Scheme Owner (Azzule) and GFSI. By executing this Agreement, Customer 
                        hereby consents to and authorizes Primus Auditing Ops to release all audit documents to the Scheme Owner and 
                        GFSI for internal use purposes.

            </p>
            <p>
                <b>6. RIGHT TO REFERRAL.</b>
               Customer acknowledges that Primus Auditing Ops is, or may, contract out the auditing services performed for Customer. 
               Because an independent auditor is engaged in his/her own independent contracting business and is not an employee of Primus 
               Auditing Ops, Primus Auditing Ops will not obtain insurance (professional liability, workers' compensation, general liability, 
               auto, etc.) for the auditor or his/her employees. Independent auditors agree by a separate referral agreement to obtain 
               his/her own insurance coverage and furnish a copy of the certificate of insurance to Primus Auditing Ops. Furthermore, 
               in those instances in which an independent auditor is retained, Primus Auditing Ops will be acting in the sole capacity of 
               independent contractor and any information or data received will be merely transmitted between parties, making no independent 
               judgment, representations or warranties as to the facts, observations or inferences made relative to same.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>7. AUDIT AND SURVEILLANCE.</b>
                Customer agrees and acknowledges free access is required to be made for scheduled audit, as well as possible random 
                surveillance pursuant to PrimusGFS scheme requirements, of customer's operation including but not limited to: 
                examination of documentation, records, and access to the equipment, location(s), area(s), personnel, and full physical 
                inspection of customer's subcontractors. Customer agrees to allow observers from Primus Auditing Ops and/or varying 
                governing bodies if customer's audit or certification is randomly selected for surveillance for quality assurance 
                purposes. Customer further agrees to grant free access in order to verify continued compliance with certification. 
                Customer acknowledges complaints related to compliance must be documented, and subsequent investigation of complaints 
                is mandatory. Documentation of complaints and investigation may be subject to inspection during audit or surveillance 
                or at the request or Primus Auditing Ops at any time. Customer acknowledges action must be taken in regards to complaints 
                or deficiencies found in products that affect certification requirements with accompanying documentation of actions taken. 
                Customer acknowledges that its failure to fully comply with this section, either during the time of audit or any other 
                time during the certification period, is a material breach of this agreement and can result in Customer's certification 
                being revoked without further notification. Therefore, customer agrees to allow observers from Primus Auditing Ops, 
                the Scheme Owner, and/or the Accreditation body to observe the conduct of any audit for any reason, including to monitor 
                auditor performance.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>8. PRODUCT CERTIFICATION.</b> Customer shall comply with the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Customer agrees to always fulfill the certification requirements.</li>
                    <li>Customer shall further comply by implementing appropriate changes when they are communicated via Primus Auditing Ops 
                    to Customer. </li>
                    <li>Additionally, customer agrees if certification applies to ongoing production that the certified product continues to 
                    fulfill the product requirements.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Request for copies of certification documents for third parties will be provided in their entirety. Customer acknowledges it 
                may not make claims in regards to certification that are inconsistent with the scope of the audit performed. Furthermore, 
                the customer may not use product certification in a manner that is misleading or unauthorized, or in a manner that would 
                damage the reputation of Primus Auditing Ops or the PrimusGFS Scheme. Additionally, customer acknowledges that if 
                certification is suspended, terminated or revoked customer must discontinue advertising any material in reference to such 
                certification and return certification documents.
                <br />
                <br />
                The customer agrees to inform Primus Auditing Ops, without delay, of changes that may affect its ability to conform to the 
                certification requirements. Examples of changes can include but are not limited to:
                <ul>
                    <li>The legal, commercial, organizational status of ownership</li>
                    <li>Organization and management e.g. key managerial, decision making or technical staff</li>
                    <li>Modifications to the product or the production method</li>
                    <li>Contact address and production sales</li>
                    <li>Major changes to the quality management system</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The customer agrees to inform Primus Auditing Ops, without delay, of any significant food safety related events including 
                recalls, outbreaks, significant regulatory food safety nonconformities, and/or food safety related prosecutions.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>9. UNANNOUNCED AUDITS.</b>
                GFSI now requires that auditees undergo an unannounced audit on a periodic basis. Customer hereby represents that it 
                acknowledges, understands, and agrees that, in conformance with GFSI requirements, and the PrimusGFS General Regulations, 
                Customer is required to, and will cooperate with the unannounced audit requirement as described in the PrimusGFS General 
                Regulations. If Customer has selected, or is selected by Primus Auditing Ops, to undergo an unannounced audit, it acknowledges 
                that it must be in production and able to accommodate the Customer's audit(s) on any dates not declared as blackout dates. 
                Failure by Customer to allow the auditor on site to perform the audit, or otherwise fail to accommodate the certification 
                process will result in cancellation of the audit and Customer will be billed, and acknowledges it will be liable to Primus 
                Auditing Ops for, a fee in an amount equal to ONE-THIRD (1/3) of the Audit Fee indicated in the “Audit Fee/Total Services” 
                box on page 1 of the Agreement.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>10. COMPLIANCE AND MARKS OF CONFORMITY, ADDENDUM “A”.</b>
                The customer must comply with any requirements that may be prescribed in the certification scheme relating to the use of 
                marks of conformity, and on information related to the audit. Additionally, in making reference to the certification in 
                communication media such as documents, brochures, or other advertising as may be permitted, Customer must comply will all 
                Primus Auditing Ops requirements and certification scheme requirements for use of Primus Auditing Ops' and the certification 
                scheme's names, marks, and logos. The parties expressly agree that the attached Addendum “A”, and all provisions listed 
                therein are hereby incorporated as an addendum to this Primus Auditing Operations PrimusGFS Service Agreement
                <br />
                <br />
                A violation of the use of the PrimusGFS trademark, as outlined herein and the attached Addendum A shall constitute a breach 
                of this Agreement by customer. In the event that Customer, its employees, or officers, improperly use the trademark and 
                logo of PrimusGFS without the consent of Primus Auditing Ops or the scheme owner, Customer shall have fifteen (15) calendar 
                days, following written notice from Primus Auditing Ops or the Scheme Owner of the improper use, to cure the improper use. 
                If Customer fails to cure the improper use, this Agreement is voidable by Primus Auditing Ops, and Customer's certification, 
                and the documents associated therewith, will be immediately revoked.
                <br />
