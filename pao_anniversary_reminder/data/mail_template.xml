                    Dear: {organization}<br/><br/>
        
                    I hope this message finds you well. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for choosing Primus Auditing Ops to conduct 
                    your third-party audits. The purpose of my email is to inform you that the certificate with number {registry_number} is about to 
                    expire, and we would like to begin the Certification process.<br/><br/>

                    We are interested in working with you, so it is necessary for you to contact us to schedule your audit. Please remember that 
                    scheduling in advance gives us the opportunity to assign the dates you propose.<br/><br/>

                    I remain attentive to any questions and thank you in advance for your support.<br/><br/>
                    
                    <a class="btn btn-primary mx-4" href="{accept_link}" target="_blank">Accept</a>
                    <a class="btn btn-primary mx-4" href="{reject_link}" target="_blank">Decline</a>
                    <br/><br/>

                    Best Regards.<br/><br/>
