                   with certain information about each other's business practices, internal documentation, and other information 
                   deemed confidential by each party. Primus Auditing Ops will keep such confidential information about Customer 
                   confidential and shall not disclose it to any third parties outside of Primus Auditing Ops, Sustainable Food Group, 
                   Azzule Systems, and any other party that Customer requests such information be released to. Any and all information 
                   provided to Sustainable Food Group from Primus Auditing Ops will remain confidential with the exception of the company 
                   name of CP's, which SFG reserves the right to publish on the Sustainability Standard website. Likewise, Customer agrees

                <p>
                    <b>6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</b>

                    employees, officers, directors, shareholders, from any loss or liability suffered by Customer, as defined below, 
                    resulting from services performed under this Agreement. Such release shall include any actual, incidental, 
                    consequential or other damages beyond amounts paid to Primus Auditing Ops for auditing performed and/or facilitated by 
                    Primus Auditing Ops. Customer further acknowledges and agrees that Primus Auditing Ops' liability is limited only to 
                    audit work performed by it, and the parties expressly acknowledge that Primus Auditing Ops is not liable for Customer's 
                    commodity, its safety, or quality. Customer further releases and holds Sustainable Food Group harmless from any liability 
                    whatsoever for the services provided under this Agreement,

                <p>
                    <b>7. GOVERNING LAW / VENUE.</b>
                    This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California. In the event that 
                    it is necessary to institute any action to enforce any right granted herein or to redress any alleged breach hereof, 
                    then the exclusive venue for such action shall reside with the applicable Superior or Municipal Court located in 
                    Santa Maria, California.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>8. GOVERNING AGENCY COMPLIANCE.</b> Customer expressly acknowledges that Primus Auditing Ops and its auditors are 
                    not a governing agency, and does not set the industry standards for safety or protocol. Customer also acknowledges 
                    that Primus Auditing Ops provides results of audits and makes no representation or warranty regarding the quality of 
                    the Customer's products, facility, fields, methods, or other audited subjects, or whether it complies with regulation 
                    standards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>9. RIGHT TO REFERRAL.</b> Customer acknowledges that Primus Auditing Ops is, or may, contract out the auditing services 
                    performed for Customer. Because an independent auditor is engaged in his/her own independent contracting business 
                    and is not an employee of Primus Auditing Ops, Primus Auditing Ops will not obtain insurance (professional liability, 
                    workers' compensation, general liability, auto, etc.) for the auditor or his/her employees. Independent auditors agree 
                    by a separate referral agreement to obtain his/her own insurance coverage and furnish a copy of the certificate of 
                    insurance to Primus Auditing Ops. Furthermore, in those instances in which an independent auditor is retained, Primus 
                    Auditing Ops will be acting in the sole capacity of an independent contractor and any information or data received will 
                    be merely transmitted between parties, making no independent judgment, representations or warranties as to the facts, 
                    observations or inferences made relative to the same. Logo use must be consistent with the SFG General Regulations, 
                    and Customer must both get permission to use the marks, and the marks themselves, from SFG.
                </p>

                    <b>10. TERM AND TERMINATION.</b>
                    This Agreement shall be good valid throughout the duration of Customer's Certification, and shall end at the time of 
                    the Certification's expiration. Provided that the representations and warranties, and ongoing obligations shall 
                    continue beyond the termination of this Agreement.

                        but after Primus Auditing Ops has begun the desktop review portion of the audit, Customer 
                        acknowledges and agrees that it shall be responsible for, and shall pay to Primus Auditing Ops,

                        box on page 1 of this Agreement. Failure on Customer's behalf to do so is a material breach of this

                </p>
                <p>
                    Customer is granted a non-exclusive and revocable sublicense for use of the Sustainability Standard 
                    Trademark on the following conditions, all of which Contracting Party acknowledges and agrees:
                </p>

                <p>
                <ul type="1">
                    <li>
                        Customer can only use the trademark and/or logo when there is a valid Sustainability Standard TM 
                        certificate linked to that organization and clear reference to the certified operations. 
                        The logo can only be used for business to business communications and marketing purposes 
                        (press releases, social media posts, websites, etc.), as long as the operation and crop certified 
                        are specified.
                    </li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>
                        The use of the Sustainability Standard Trademark shall not appear on the product, or consumer 
                        packaging, nor shall it be used at the point of sale in direct connection to single products.

                    <li>

                    <li>
                        The Sustainability Standard Trademark must be obtained from Primus Auditing Operations, 
                        in order to ensure conformance with exact corporate color and format, and may only be 
                        used in a manner consistent with Sustainability StandardTM requirements.

                    <br/>
                    <li>Customer shall at all times cooperate with Sustainable Food Group and its agents

                            <li>Customer fails to meet re-certification requirements;</li>
                            <li>Customer uses the logo in a manner that is detrimental to Sustainable

                            <li>Upon written notice to Customer of such suspension or revocation, Customer 
                            agrees to immediately discontinue using Sustainability Standard Trademark and 
                            cease use of promotional materials, websites or communications on which the 
                            Sustainability Standard Trademark is published.</li>
